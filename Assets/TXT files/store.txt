Break your bad working habits by taking regular breaks!







Breakr is an app meant to help you take breaks during your time working at a desk in front of a monitor. A timer is set up that will allocate time for breaks and let you know what break to take and when to take it. You could do this yourself by setting multiple timers on your phone, but using Breakr makes this easier, so that you can focus on your work instead of being distracted by timers.

There are three types of breaks. The most frequent is a break for taking your eyes off the monitor. The next most frequent break is for taking a short rest to relax. The least frequent break is slightly longer and involves taking a quick walk and doing some light exercise.

The app is not necessarily just for desk work involving a monitor, but could be used in any work that involves stillness and monotonous movements.
